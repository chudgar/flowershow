# First heading

For a while when I was in graduate school in Chicago, very unhappy in love and life, I spent many summer days outside a nearby coffeeshop. There, staring longingly at the handsome fellows walking up and down Broadway while pretending to read, I got to be friendly with the other habitués of the place. I thoroughly enjoyed their company, in the easy way of fellow-regulars who share the same place for a while. 

Certain evenings at about six-thirty, a few of my coffeeshop companions would get up and go somewhere together. As a group, they were wildly various: a serene Buddhist bodybuilder who lived a simple life on disability; a witty and profane woman with ruby-red hair who sped hazardously up the sidewalk on a wheelchair bedazzled with jewels; a shy bear with a luxuriant salt-and-pepper mustache; a sardonic young novelist who made his living writing copy for Tony the Tiger. There were often others, too, who seemed to belong to the same secret society — some of whom would come to the coffeeshop for weeks on end, just like the rest of us, only to vanish without explanation, never to return. When I’d ask the regulars where so-and-so had gone, they’d sigh, exchange sad looks, and offer baffling answers like “oh, he had to do some research” or “she went back out.” Research about what? Out where? I didn’t ask. I had few friends in those days, and in my heart hoped that my coffeeshop acquaintances were silently evaluating me for membership in their secret society. I did not want to dash my hopes of being included by asking silly questions. 

But one day, as the gang arose from the coffeeshop to depart at their usual time, chatting and laughing in their warm companionable way, I finally demanded where the hell they all went together every evening, and why they never invited me. 

The bodybuilder and the redhead in the wheelchair looked sideways at each other and chuckled confidentially. 

“Oh, we go to hang out with other weirdos like us,” he said, and winked. 

“More like mental defectives,” the woman chuckled. 

“I’m kind of a weirdo myself,” I replied. 

The bodybuilder patted my shoulder with what felt like genuine fondness. “You very well might be, sweetheart.” 

The redhead giggled. “I’d be amazed if he weren’t,” she told him. And then the two of them rolled off companionably to be with the misfits. I remember wanting to cry as I watched them go.

A few years later, when I stumbled into my first A.A. meeting in the social hall underneath the church I attended on Sundays, the bodybuilder was there. He startled when he saw me. Having feared above all else that someone I know would be there, I must have gone white as a sheet. 

“Well hello there,” he said, smiling but serious.“You go to this church, right?” 

I nodded in terror. 

“If you’re here for a church thing, honey,” he replied, “it’s probably upstairs.” 

I felt my heart break in my chest. I’d learned about the A.A. meeting from the bulletin I got at mass every Sunday. I thought it was a church thing; I thought I’d be allowed. Going to the meeting had been a desperate Hail Mary, and now I would simply have to take my own life. 

The bodybuilder looked at me piercingly for a moment, and his eyes widened. “Oh!” he said. “Ah. This is your first meeting, isn’t it?” 

I nodded. 

“Your first meeting ever, in life?” 

I nodded again. 

A broad grin spread across his face, as pure and welcome as the first ray of sunshine after a long dark night. “Jesus Christ, of *course.* I’m so sorry, honey. You’ve come to the right place.”

A few minutes later, I found myself perched on a folding chair among a circle of a dozen wildly assorted people, all apparently alcoholics — old and young, athletic and jaundiced, threadbare and stylish. The only person I recognized from church was one of the little deacons, who nodded at me solemnly. Somebody had put what looked like a stout blue hymnal in my lap, and somebody else had put a styrofoam cup of weak black coffee in one of my hands and a slightly damaged Oreo. The bodybuilder loomed protectively to my right, like a small mountain or a big brother. 

I listened with Gospel-close attention — it was the social hall, of course, but church is church — as a friendly panhandler I recognized from outside the 7-Eleven read aloud from a tattered three-ring binder. 

“Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.” The words shocked me — not because I heard the shameless puffery of the failed thirties businessman who wrote them, but because I had the sense, for the first time in my life, that there was a path to follow to become part of an us. It was “our” path: if I followed it thoroughly, I would not fail.

For eleven years and two weeks after that day, I thoroughly followed their path, and I became one of them. Even thought it’s been years since I left both sobriety and the fellowship, xxx
