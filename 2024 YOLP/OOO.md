# 15, Object-Oriented Ontology
OOO is the thing I wanted to write about going in. In brief, it’s a movement in recent philosophy to think seriously about real objects (this is controversial) rather than just thinking, at one remove, about how we think. Once you make that kind of maneuver on purpose, you encounter all kinds of real stuff in the world, and you quickly come to the conclusion that there’s no inherent hierarchy of beings, in which some things are “realer” than others. In OOO, for example, I’m no more real than the bacteria in my gut, which are no more real than (for instance) a scientific paper about the bacteria in my gut. As one philosopher of OOO puts it, “All objects are not equal, but all objects equally are.”
