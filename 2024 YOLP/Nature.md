# Nature

Having sp As I’ve learned from Bruno Latour and Timothy Morton, “Nature” is a modern hallucination, magicked out of the infinite diversity of all things seen and unseen as a conceptual foil for Humanity. If it seems weird 

“The Earth,” these days, is a frequent planetary emblem for the sum of nonhuman Nature, which Man must either treat better (like the bad man who’s yet to stop beating his wife) or else master and subdue (like the same man otherwise described). You can see the trouble: the Earth can’t _help_ being defined by Man as its abuser or caretaker.

Fortunately for us, though, the imponderably vast array of beings in, on, and around our planet have no idea that they are part of “the Earth,” and — for the most part — will simply go about their affairs, blissfully unaware of their _very important_ difference from human beings. Yes, we are making life much more wretched for many of the other kinds of beings nearby us, like almost all other animals. But we are making life much easier (and perhaps even more enjoyable) for many _other_ neighbors, like coronaviruses, marijuana plants, and ancient bacteria now stirring back to life in the thawing tundra. And for the titanic majority of beings in our orbit, seen and unseen, they are indifferent to our existence at all. The point isn’t that we _shouldn’t_ “save the Earth”: it’s that we, human beings, should get over the idea that we’re somehow different from every other kind of being. They have interests; so do we. Sometimes they align, sometimes they don’t.

Taking responsibility for _that_ almost unthinkable reality, it seems to me, is a humiliation our species will either face, or perish in disavowing.
