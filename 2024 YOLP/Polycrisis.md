# Heading

In the mornings my husband likes to read the news with his coffee, but this morning I found him crocheting instead. 

“No news?” I asked. 

“Too much news,” he replied. 

You know the feeling, don’t you? 

The specific fears of old Iowans aside, I think it’s safe to say those Iowa caucusgoers feel the nation is headed to hell in a hand-basket. Though you may not agree with Iowa Republicans’ analysis of the present crisis — I certainly don’t, yeesh — you can’t help but sympathize with their sense of impending doom, right? The world is on *fire,* my friends, and everybody knows it. It’s stressful for all of us. 

Our age, the suspenseful Anthropocene, is a fractal catastrophe, expanding in all directions with the eager speed of nasty positive feedback. The more sea ice melts, the faster it melts; the more species perish, the faster. Being only human, you can’t pay attention to all these catastrophes at once, so you rely on your sense of who you are and what matters to figure out which crises to focus on, which to feel bad about *not* focusing on, which to dissociate away, and which to decide are good, actually. 

As I write this, the Professor shakes his head disapprovingly. 

“You’re being facetious,” he grumbles, “but this sort of discernment really matters, and I think you should take it seriously.” 

 “I am taking it seriously,” I protest. “
