# If dollar bills could 

Capital, as I understand it, is _plural_ in being _distributed_ ‚Äî sort of like the millions of bacteria in a biofilm, or like the vast colonies of aspen clones that span hundreds of miles in the forests of Oregon. Or, more newsily, like a virus, which _seems_ like just an inert little crystal thing, innocent as a mineral, until it encounters an environment (like a human throat, for instance) in which its tiny body feels, finally, welcome. Then it reproduces as quickly as it can, mutating now and then as it learns what works best to secure a future for its kind. 

Capital is like that, I think: it only _seems_ inert. The dollar bill you are carrying in your wallet is just a husk, a capsid, a chemical coat with secret instructions for inside it. If you take the dollar to the bank and put it into your account, it‚Äôll start reproducing ‚Äî slowly, of course, because dollars reproduce more quickly when there are more of them in one place, and I am sure your bank account does not have enough to heat things up, reproductively. 

Look elsewhere for that: look at places where thousands or millions or even _billions_ of dollars go to reproduce ‚Äî the damp organs of humanity, like banks, legislatures, health systems, cities. Those are the places capital has come to feel welcome; and the more capital those organs attract, the more it reproduces. Mere reproduction is all capital is generally understood to want. But that‚Äôs quite naive, isn‚Äôt it? Human beings reproduce, like all living things ‚Äî but we don‚Äôt just reproduce _ourselves_ in the form of children, we reproduce the _conditions_ for our reproduction, too. Behold, here I am, barren of offspring ‚Äî but creating culture right this second! I too contribute to the reproduction of humanity, in that I am doing my tiny little bit to keep human culture fresh and nourishing, without which human babies wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance. 

Every day my countless brethren and I scurry forth in single file across the forest floor of culture in search of precisely the right leaves, which we use our sturdy mental mandibles to saw into bite-sized bits. These we tote back home, holding them aloft like tiny green flags, to the special chambers where our farmer colleagues coax them to grow the meal of meaning that nourishes our society. 

I think capital reproduces the conditions for its own reproduction, too. (I seem to recall that Marx said something to that effect.) Here is the moral of the story, as I see it: As it turns out, human flourishing is _not_ the condition under which capital believes it reproduces best. In fact, there is every indication that capital is entirely indifferent to the welfare of human beings, or indeed any other kind of being. I believe that is why many of the vital organs to which we have consigned much of human life ‚Äî the American healthcare system, for example, or global supply chains ‚Äî flourish despite their obvious, unconcealed hostility to the welfare of the human beings who sustain _them_.
