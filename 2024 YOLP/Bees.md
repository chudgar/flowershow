# 2, Bees

Imagines a honeybee’s life! In which every moment is meaningful, for every action tends _only_ to the greater good. Imagine living in a suit of splendid gold-and-black furr and diaphanous wings, toiling with endless stamina among plants custom-wrought by countless millennia of evolution to seduce _our_ sensory capabilities in particular. Imagine living among the blandishments of flowers’ perfumes, rich pollen, exalting nectar, all-comforting sweet wax. If you were a bee, you could say: We converse by dancing meaningfully. We defend our little ones and our dear mother with perfect valor, since each of us draws effortlessly upon the courage of all.
