# Democratic backsliding 

> I grew up thinking democracy was the culmination of human social organization, and that our job was just to perfect it. Now we’re learning it may have been a phase. — Michael Tomasky, “[I Never Thought I’d Live to See Democracy Die](https://newrepublic.com/article/176057/democracy-israel-attack-trump-authoritarianism)” (2023)

Thinking about “living plurally” has made me think a lot about about democracy. As I see it, democratic government distributes decision-making authority broadly end evenly among the many members of a community. By distributing power from the start, democracies often evolve to become even more plural over time, as the community extends full membership to more and more of its inhabitants. 

Other political systems take the opposite approach, concentrating power in a powerful minority (like clergy, the military, or aristocrats) or even a single person (like a monarch or a dictator). With no mechanism for securing a majority’s agreement with exercises of state power, non-democratic regimes mostly rule by coercion, and conflict among aspirants to concentrated power frequently causes violence. 

Growing up American in the late Cold War, as the child of an immigrant from a British colony, I have never once questioned the fundamental rightness of democracy. Until very recently, it has never occurred to me that anyone else would, either. Yet the news is very clear: even as the sea ice recedes and the tundra melts, enthusiasm for government by common consent is dramatically weakening in large-scale human communities around the world. 

The decline of democracy bothers the members of my inner community a lot, in several different ways. 

- **Fairness.** The youngest parts of me, though not particularly political, feel a queasy sense that the grown-up world can no longer be counted on to uphold the basic mechanism, learned in kindergarten and never before questioned, of voting. To the Badger, a situation in which a majority *of adults* let a minority among them decide matters of common consequence — like who gets to be president, for example — is a scandal that calls the very concept of adulthood into question. It’s enough to keep an inner child up at night. 
- **Safety.** The parts of my personality who keep an eye out for external threats object to the decline of democracy for reasons of mere prudence. My husband and I are queer, childless, and aging rapidly; we depend on a fraying democratic consensus about the validity of our marriage, our claim to the equal protection of the laws, and the state’s responsibility to care for people who can no longer work. 

I think about this a lot, because the people of my mother’s and father’s home countries — the world’s oldest and most populous democracies respectively — seem to be losing interest in governing themselves. 

Just last week, a few thousand Republican seniors in Iowa defied the bitter cold and the blinding snow to cast their votes for a president who openly rejects the legitimacy of votes cast against him and repeatedly, loudly declares his *intention* to govern as an theocrat if returned to power. Later this year, unless popular opinion changes dramatically, the overwhelming majority of India’s billion citizens will cast their votes for a religious nationalist tyrant of their own. In both nations, lots of people — a majority in India, and a powerful minority here — believe that secular, diverse democracy has failed them, and they want out. 

Not everybody agrees about that, of course. There are still tens of millions of us in the U.S., and presumably hundreds of millions of Indians, who have faith that *only* secular democracy can shepherd our vast and diverse societies through this age of accelerating global omnicrisis. We point out, correctly, that our nations were founded *as* secular democracies, in super-duper explicit contrast to the imperial British monarchs from whom we liberated ourselves. Wasn’t that the whole point of our nations to begin with? 

But our neighbors who vote for tyrants are not really contesting that point, from what I can tell. They seem to believe that secular democracy is working more-or-less as intended by the framers of our constitutions; they just don’t like *how* it is working. The wrong

# Democracy from the inside out

> The future of democracy and democratic freedom depends on our capacity … to recognize that it is simply impossible to struggle successfully against hatred outside ourselves, while ignoring its messages within. — Alice Miller, *The Drama of the Gifted Child* (1979)


# How inner democracies die

> Protectors want to speak for and about exiles. They have an agenda and they want to control the narrative, which can be very inaccurate. Accordingly, I have a democracy rule (my only rule for therapy): Every part speaks for itself. — Martha Sweezy, *Internal Family Systems for Shame and Guilt* (2023)

# Plural practices for a healthier inner democracy 

## №. 🌞 Draft an internal constitution

A constitution, as I understand it, is a written-down agreement among people about how they are going to govern themselves. The bylaws of an association are a kind of constitution, as are the agreed-upon community standards of a therapy group. 

If you are 

- Who or what gets to belong to our inner community? What distinguishes us from not-us? What binds us to each other? 
- How should we settle disputes among ourselves? 
- How do we make decisions about matters that affect our common welfare? 
- How do we made quick decisions in emergencies when there’s no time for deliberation? 
- Who or what represents our community in relations with external others? 
- How can we make sure safety, resources, and dignity are equitably distributed among us? 
- Under what circumstances can our constitution be revised?
