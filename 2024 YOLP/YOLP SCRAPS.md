If you had to learn to navigate the grown-up world on the young side, the way I did, there’s probably a trusty Johnny-type character in your inner system too. Practical, hard-working, motivated and motivational, these parts of ourselves are dedicated to our betterment. Based on past experience, they often believe we’re not good enough as we are — in big ways left over from childhood trauma (*broken and unloveable*), in response to social oppression (*too fat,* *too angry,* *too gay*), or just in the ordinary everyday shame that a manger-dominated culture whispers constantly into our ears (*disorganized*, *unproductive*, *weak*).

And: “In many ways, they have sacrificed the opportunity to express and experience their own desires and emotions, their own sense of abandonment and despair, and their own interests and talents in order to hide and protect the vulnerable exiled parts” (115).
