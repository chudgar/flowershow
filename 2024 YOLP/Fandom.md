# 6, Fandom

No, not “family,” or even “fellowship,” which we shall discuss by other names: fandom is a more potent kind of plural lifestyle, often stricly limited in time and space — Dorothy Zbornak, whose fandom is thriving in America, was the president of her high school’s [50s strongman]() fan club, and his fandom is globally extinct. 

Last night, we watched John Wilson respectfully infiltrate a tiny group of _Avatar_ fans, who had learned to get by in conversational Na’avi and truly, deeply loved each other. One young man, maybe twenty-two, told how he’d been on the brink of taking his own life, only to discover in an _Avatar_ meetup group “the father he never had.” That man, barely older than the first, nodded solemnly, with tears in his eyes. Those fans, it seemed to me, are more than most “families,” who are held together by nothing but blood, custom and the tax code. They are held together by believing the same things are sacred, worth living for, worth saving each other to live for together.
