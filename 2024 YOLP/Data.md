# 📊 The abstract delight of measuring 

For years now, for reasons I have never completely understood, Johnny has taken it upon himself to log, measure, tally, and graph all manner of facts about my inner and outer environments. He is like a diligent little scientist, patient and precise, quiet and curious. Over the years he has cheerfully tracked data including:

- words written (per day, chapter, paragraph, sentence, etc.);
- number of A.A. meetings attended;
- geographic location by year;
- personality traits by decade; 
- sexual encounters by act, partner(s), and outcomes; 
- workday time allocation by quarter-hour; 
- pushups performed; 

and so forth. 

He seldom offers his opinion about the merits of the life choices that generate the data; he seems to enjoy it for its own sake, and the rest of us enjoy his enjoyment and welcome the #dataviz #insights we find in his tables and charts. There is no satisfaction quite as pure as the warm tingle that ripples through our body when Johnny, after who knows how many hours of hyperfocus, transforms a jagged heap of hostile numbers into a parrot-bright graph that glows with meaning.
