# 7, Gays

I suspect that all the many kinds of animals who gather by strict necessity at watering holes do not feel any particular solidarity with each other. Neither, alas, have I ever felt any particular solidarity with “the queer community,” or even with other gay men like me. 

You must understand this grieves me terribly. I think, nowadays, about how queer theory was in full flower in the late nineties, when I trembled prematurely into college, and how I might have met the courageous and brilliant queer people who were determined to find in our shared sexuality a source of liberation and political power. 

Instead, I spent every night in the dark gay bar near campus, where I was almost always the only college kid around. That was my “gay community,” such as it was: A bunch of men in a windowless room in an unmarked building, anxiously circling each other in a haze of smoke, beers in hand, scanning each other for furtive signs of lust, or threat, or both. It wasn’t fun, although I thought it was. It wasn’t home, although I thought it was that too. But it _was_ a community, because all the men at that bar were all there for the same reason: to use each other to scratch some private itch for ourselves. And it was a community, too, because we feared the same hatred, and we feared the same disease.
